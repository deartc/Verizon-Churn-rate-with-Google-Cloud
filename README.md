Verizon Google

Background and Objectives:

VerizonGoogle, VerizonAWS, and VerizonAzure are three projects that are using the same Verizon data. 
Each will be done with the same data but use the ML in each specific cloud. 

ADVANCED ANALYSIS:
Google Machine Learning/ Vertex/ML        
 
 

Verizon is an Internet, phone, and TV provider that has one of the best retention rates of customers (churn) in the world. This public source data set has recorded information about customers at the time of their contract renewal. The project examines factors that influence customer churn rates.

Status of project and future steps:

Defining the question:  What  makes these customers more likely to not renew their service and identify the patterns and then recommend a marketing campaign?                             
Collecting the data:      The Verizon data was found and the dataset was included in Github repository.

Cleaning the data:        The data was cleaned (more cleaning may be necessary).

Analyzing the data:       The data was initially analyzed (more analysis may be necessary).

Sharing your results:      Initial results were displayed in Tableau and Matplot. 


Future steps:            

  
 1.  I am using these projects to learn more hands-on about the cloud.  I wanted to show hands-on learning about machine learning using three cloud providers:  AWS ML, Azure ML (Sage Maker,) and Google ML (Vertex). 
 2. Refine data. Possibly do more cleaning and analysis using SQL. I have several classes in SQl and have used it in project situations but I need to use it more effectively but prefer to focus on other areas now.
 3.  I want to use basic AI on how to retain customers who are more likely to not retain services.
