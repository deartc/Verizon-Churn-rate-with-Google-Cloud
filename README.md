Verizon Google

Background and Objectives:

VerizonGoogle, VerizonAWS, and VerizonAzure are three projects that are using the same Verizon data. 
Each will be done with the same data but use the ML in each specific cloud. 

ADVANCED ANALYSIS:
Google Machine Learning/ Vertex/ML        
 
 

Verizon is an Internet, phone, and TV provider that has one of the best retention rates of customers (churn) in the world. This public source data set has recorded information about customers at the time of their contract renewal. The project examines factors that influence customer churn rates.

Status of project and future steps:

Defining the question:  What  makes these customers more likely to not renew their service and identify the patterns and then recommend a marketing campaign?                             
Collecting the data:      The Verizon data was found and the dataset was included in Github repository.

Cleaning the data:        The data was cleaned (more cleaning may be necessary).

Analyzing the data:       The data was initially analyzed (more analysis may be necessary).

Sharing your results:      Initial results were displayed in Tableau and Matplot. 


Future steps:            

  
 1.  I am using these projects to learn more hands-on about the cloud.  I wanted to show hands-on learning about machine learning using three cloud providers:  AWS ML, Azure ML (Sage Maker,) and Google ML (Vertex).  (I have never even attempted this and need direction on how to do it as a beginner. I would love to focus on this since this is something I am having a problem breaking down on how to learn how to do it.)  I have read about Vertex at a basic level and how to theoretically do this but unsure best way to proceed.
 2.    I took a FinOps class and recently passed the certification recommended by a former mentor (who helped me obtain free training and a certification voucher)  to feel more comfortable with billing.   I am trying to use the free Google Cloud lab access to get to the stage of passing the certification test and eventually feel comfortable enough to set up my account with billing parameters.  I also took and passed the Google Data Analytics certification to learn how to do it but the focus was on tools to do it so learned about R and data graphics.  I recently took and passed a Linux Foundation certification test based primarily on cloud principles to learn more about Linux so I am more comfortable with the cloud shell.  I took statistics in graduate school and took several wonderful online structured class on how to set up training models so I know the fundamental on how theoretically how to do it.  I hope to attend Women in the cloud and an machine learning Google group webinars to supplement my learning.  
      


 3. Use Python for two and R for one project:   I have attended several Python classes from Standford (Code in Place).  Two excellent ones from Code Louisville where I had formal projects.  I  try to update my coding by classes like recent WeloveCloud but haven't coded regularly.
 4.  R : I attended a formal University class that taught R but no real project using it.  The Google data analytics course certification I took recently was taught primarily with R.  I am supplementing training later with free Vanderbilt online classes and another excellent one from a Canadian library.
 5.  Use different graphics for each:
    Power Bi,  I took several short-term classes in this but have not used it except on a  limited basis).
    I am involved in a Power Bi PowerUp program now and a Digital program that teaches Power Bi.  
                         
 Tableau: I took a Code Louisville course in data science that used Pluralsight for Tableau and watched webinars from Australian data schools. I will take a Tableau class from a university in Fall.

Google Analytical Visual tools:  I need to learn more to use




 7.  Refine data. Possibly do more cleaning and analysis using SQL. I have several classes in SQl and have used it in project situations but I need to use it more effectively but prefer to focus on other areas now.
 8.  I want to use basic AI on how to retain customers that are more likely to not retain services.  I learned about Microsoft AI and got formal training and certification from MIcrosoft and Women in Technology two years ago but it was all theory.  I am trying to learn through   the Microsoft PowerUp program to design apps using AI.  I would like to continue with my access to Google lab to learn more about Google AI.
